Compiling and running:

Should be as simple as
>oclc mp5vv
>./mp5vv

If you have any trouble, please let me know.

Features:

*(pseudo)random emission - at each emission step, a random point in the y=0 plane is chosen from which the particles are emitted in a vertical column
*emission is controlled via atomic incrementing
*When particles hit the ground, they are pooled and will then be emitted again at the next emission step 
*4 collision spheres - I chose not to render them as I thought the particles themselves were way more interesting
*Each sphere has unique color attributes, so particles that hit it will change to a different color
*Vortex force from your original example is unchanged.  Collision is reworked to properly work with spheres
*Increasing restitution and decreasing friction should make fewer particles stick to spheres

The high emission rate should make sure ~ 1 million particles are almost always on screen.  If you would like to be certain, you can just ratchet up
EMIT_RATE in mp5vv.cl

For this assignment, I largely cannibalized the code from your velocity verlet example, so much of the code is the same.
